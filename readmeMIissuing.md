> [Sandbox Access Request Form](https://developer.mastercard.com/card-issuance/tutorial/try-sandbox-apis/step2/) - Why would the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency deny a bank identification number but for closed source software and yet without personal vouchers? If FINRA would like to prove playing an honest game, would they like to try and prevent personally identifiable information to be shared with aggregate brokerage data? Wouldn’t a comment box reconcile good will for FINRA’s intents and purposes? Can a competitor be an inside trader? (*Does someone need to pay sales taxes on selling to friends under [$15k/year](https://truncatedwholesaletax.com)?*)
